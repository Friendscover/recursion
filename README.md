# Recursion
This is my take on TheOdinProjects "Recursion" project!
* [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/recursion)

If you wanna run the code run it from the main directory. 
```
ruby lib/fibonacci.rb
ruby lib/merge_sort.rb
```

Merge Sort was kinda hard to implement. I had to wrap my head around the recursion a few times.
